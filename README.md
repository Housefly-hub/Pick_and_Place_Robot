# ü§ñ Pick and Place Robot using Micro-Electromagnet Gripper

This is an Arduino-based Pick and Place robot that uses a micro-electromagnet as a gripper to pick up small metal cubes and place them in a looped sequence. The robot combines servo and stepper motors to perform automated pick-and-place operations.

## üéØ Objective

Design and implement a robotic arm capable of picking up small metallic objects using a micro-electromagnet and placing them at predefined locations in a loop using Arduino control.

## üß† How It Works

- The **servo motor** rotates the robot arm to specific angles.
- The **stepper motor** moves the arm vertically to pick or place an object.
- The **micro-electromagnet** acts as a gripper to lift and release metal cubes.
- A **limit switch** is used for homing the vertical axis.
- The robot starts on button press and executes a predefined loop of pick-and-place steps.

---

## üíª Arduino Code

The main Arduino sketch is in `PickandPlace_Robot.cpp`. It includes:
- `EndEffector` class to manage electromagnet control.
- Smooth servo rotation through gradual positioning.
- Homing and referencing of the vertical axis.
- A loop that controls multiple pick and place movements.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Assemble the mechanical frame and wiring.
2. Change the extension of the sketch from `.cpp` to `.ino`
3. Upload `PickandPlace_Robot.ino` to the Arduino UNO.
4. Power the circuit using a 12V 5A SMPS.
5. Press the button to start the loop.
6. The robot will automatically run through the predefined pick and place routine.
